We're announcing a new GLaMS-associated workshop **"professional skills"** (i.e. **tech** skills).
Attendees of the Lean workshop may be interested in certain sessions in preparation for the projects later.
But they are not the only target audience: anybody interested in making use of **tech** in **mathematical research**.

## Time, Location and Zoom

The workshop will run in a **hybrid** format **fortnightly** on **Tuesday**
afternoons at **3:30pm - 5pm**, starting on **February 6**.

In Edinburgh, this will take place in room **5.45 in Bayes**.
You can also join online on zoom:
- [zoom link](https://ed-ac-uk.zoom.us/j/88333909938)
- password: *check email to glams mailing list*

If you can't make a session you're interested in, there will also be
[recaps posted](https://glams-professional-skills.github.io/website/recaps/).


## Content

The **first** session will be themed around **terminals** and **shells**. Other
themes planned in the workshop (intended to be independent) include:
- version control with **Git** (*useful for Lean4 workshop projects*)
    - practicalities with LaTeX projects
- **LaTeX**
    - advanced **TikZ**
    - bibliography practicalities
- personal/workshop **website** creation
- Computer algebra

There is an opportunity to suggest themes in the contact form in the
[Keep up to date] section.

## Keep up to date

There **isn't an expected progression** for attendants throughout the
workshop sessions. So you are more than welcome to **only attend** for the
**occasional session** depending on the **theme**.
To keep track of the workshop themes, you can sign up for email updates
[with this form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=sAafLmkWiUWHiRCgaTTcYSk46CC55_BEsRipfVdSTE1URjI2NlhXQ1lWVzJXSjFENldJTUIyNU5RSi4u).

## Format

The concept of the workshop is to provide a space to spend time learning about
**tech** we wished we knew more about, in a **social space** with
**experts around**.
For this goal, the standard workshop **format** will start with a **short talk** based
around the theme, to act as an **overview** rather than a tutorial. This is
followed by **unstructured** time to work on **exercise prompts** (with **wide range** of
required experience), or bring forward your **own projects/issues/discussions**.

For a few sessions (at least one), there will instead be **showcases** from people using
technology in their **mathematical research** for inspiration.
