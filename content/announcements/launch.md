## First session content

The first session will provisionally be themed around the terminal and unix-like shells with a rough format of:
- an introductory talk about the workshop as a whole
- a talk around the theme
- a range of exercise prompts (with very large variety in difficulty and experience needed), and time to experiment with topics in the theme
