# New Week... New Workshop *
\* only expect this 50% of weeks

|  |  |
|-:|-|
| Theme: | **Terminals and shells** |
| Time: | **15:30-17:00 - Feb 6** |
| Location: | **Bayes 5.45** (check email for zoom) |

Bring a laptop (that's it). Consider creating a GitHub account (especially on Windows), less important this week but allows you to try software without installing it.

Expect a short **intro talk** (30mins?) to set the scene, with hopefully a little nugget of something for **everyone**.
Then hang around to **try** some of the things **mentioned in talk** (take your pick). There's easy explanatory examples, but also hard exercises.
It's an opportunity to chat, ask instructor, ask chatgpt/copilot, and get a feel for what is out there. No need to learn everything in one go.

If you're feeling nosy, take a sneak peek at the [exercise prompts](https://github.com/GLAMS-professional-skills/workshop1-terminals-and-shells) for the session.
