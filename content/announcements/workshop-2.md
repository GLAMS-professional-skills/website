| Title: | **Git Started** |
| Theme: | **Git** (version control) |
| Time: | **15:30-17:00 - Feb 20** |
| Location: | ~~**Bayes 5.45**~~ **JCMB 5205** (check email for zoom) |

Bring a laptop. Create a [GitHub](https://github.com) account.

- Heard of, but never used Git?
- Comfortable with Git but haven't done much other than add, commit, push/pull?
- Had to use Git but don't really see any benefit?

Then I probably have someting for you.

Expect a short **intro talk** (30mins?) to set the scene, with hopefully a little nugget of something for **everyone**.
Then hang around to **try** some of the things **mentioned in the talk** (take your pick).
There's introductory examples (recommended as a minimum for the Lean course), but also exercise prompts to try more **advanced features**.
It's an opportunity to chat, ask instructor, ask chatgpt/copilot, and get a feel for what is out there. No need to learn everything in one go.

If you're feeling nosy, take a sneak peek at some of the
[slides](https://uoe-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/s1511002_ed_ac_uk/EQNuvOei0rtIkMpnBeD8c_gBVXl1khyD5twnESxjlfBi3g?e=vH8OM0)
for the session.
