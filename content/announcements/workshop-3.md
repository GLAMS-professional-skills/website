| Title: | **Git Started** |
| Theme: | **Computational Category Theory** (julia library catlab.jl) |
| Time: | **15:30-17:00 - Mar 12** |
| Location: | **JCMB 5205** (check email for zoom) |

Bring a laptop. Create a [GitHub](https://github.com) account.

We're going to explore a library for the title subject: [catlab](https://algebraicjulia.github.io/Catlab.jl/)
(I heard that John Baez may be involved with this or a wider project? Don't quote).

Things to get out of this session:
- Check out what computational category theory has to offer
- Some broadening experience with a programming language other than Python/R/SageMath
- General computer troubleshooting if you decide to install this yourself
