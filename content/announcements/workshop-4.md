# What to expect?

An opportunity to experiment with stuff in LaTeX in a space together, because you don't want to risk doing it on your own in your current project...

- preamble precompilation: go fast faster?
- latexmk: configure how to build your document
- subfiles: package existing documents into chapters?
- LuaTeX: programming TeX?
- bibliography stuff: I'm trash at this, maybe you can advice off other attendees?
