Want to really get good at Bash or powershell? Try out the corresponding tracks on [exercism](https://exercism.org/) (there's also a track `awk`, a complementary tool if using Bash a lot).
LinkedIn Learning also has relevant courses with exercises (UoE have free access).

For other computer literacy, this playlist on youtube may also be useful: [Computer Stuff They Didn't Teach You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDXmTJakpT8&list=PL0M0zPgJ3HSesuPIObeUVQNbKqlw5U2Vr)


This first session was all trying out the things which shells allow you to do.

**Next week:** Git (probably part 1/n)

**What to expect:** Git knowledge is necessary for the Lean course, but is occasionally used to manage LaTeX projects. Or maybe you're looking at developing some non-academic skills. Some Git is good to know.
- Heard of, but never used Git?
- Comfortable with Git but haven't done much other than add, commit, push/pull?
- Had to use Git but don't really see any benefit?

Then I probably have something for you. Get ready for contrived version control nightmares (as well as introductory examples) in the workshop exercises that will make you feel the power.
